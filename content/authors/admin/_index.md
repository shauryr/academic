🎓🚀 I am an incoming Computational Scientist at the Research Computing Centre at the University of Chicago 🏫, with a passion for skiing ⛷️ in the winter and playing tennis 🎾 in the summer.

I earned my Ph.D. at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), The Pennsylvania State University, under the guidance of [Prof. C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) 🎓✨. As a member of [The Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/), I contributed extensively to the [CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index) [project](http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/) 📚🔬.

Collaborating closely with [Dr. Jian Wu](https://fanchyna.wixsite.com/jianwu) 🤝, I have been responsible for research, crawling, updating the index, and maintaining the large-scale repository of academic documents (over 20M documents) 🌐🔎.

My thesis centered on building advanced indexing and retrieval techniques for Math Search 🔢🔍, working on the [MathSeer](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/) project with the support of [Dr. Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/) 📐🧠.

I've had the unique honor of working alongside fantastic people at [Allen AI](https://allenai.org/) in the [Semantic Scholar Team](https://www.semanticscholar.org/), where I received mentorship from [Sergey Feldman](https://www.data-cowboys.com/) and [Doug Downey](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/) 🌟🤖. I'm also very proud of being the creator of S2QA Semantic Scholar Question Answering—a first-of-its-kind generative AI QA system that can cite papers using GPT-4 🧩🤯.

Previously, my professional journey as a researcher led me to the Tata Innovation Labs, where I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Puneet Agarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agarwalpuneet/) 🧪🚀.I am an incoming Computational Sceintist at the Research Computing Centre at University of Chicago.
