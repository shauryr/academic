I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), The Pennsylvania State University. I am advised by [Prof. C.Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). I am a member of [The Intelligent Information Systems Research Laboratory](http://iis.ist.psu.edu/) in which I work specifically on the [CiteSeerX](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index) [project](http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/). 

Here, with the help of [Dr. Jian Wu](https://fanchyna.wixsite.com/jianwu) I am responsible for research, crawling, updating the index and maintaining the repository of academic documents at scale(>20M documents).  My thesis is on building advanced indexing and retrieval techniques for Math Search. This work is under the project [MathSeer](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/) on which I am actively working. 

Previously, I have worked with [Dr. Puneet Agarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agarwalpuneet/) at the Tata Innovation Labs as a Researcher.
